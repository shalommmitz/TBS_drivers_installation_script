# A Script to Install Drivers for TBS Sat Receivers

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

The original script is from https://www.tbsdtv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=87&t=25391

This original script was written by andreril at Mon Oct 26 2020. I could not find any farther info on the original author.

The script was modified to delete both media and media_build in case of re-install

There is an alternative script at: https://cesbo.com/download/astra/scripts/drv-tbs.sh
This script, which was not tested, might be better because it installs support for more controller-chips.
