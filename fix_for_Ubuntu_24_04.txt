Issue: "make" fails

Solution: 

- Delete the file `media_build/backports/v6.8-ccs.patch`

- Delete the line containing "v6.8-ccs" from the file `media_build/backports/backports.txt`

- Edit the file `media_build/v4l/ccs-core.c`
  
    In the line (#668?) that contains `pm_runtime_get_if_active(&client->dev, true);` remove the `, true`

- Run: `cd media_build; make cleanall; make dir DIR=../media`

- Run: `cd media_build; sudo make install`
